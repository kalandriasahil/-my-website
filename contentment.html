<h1 style="color:red;">CONTENTMENT:</h1>
<q style="font-size:50;">"Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough" 
― Oprah Winfrey</q>
<p style="color:blue;">
Contentment is the state of being happy and satisfied. 
Contentment means limiting one's desires.It means to be happy with the things one have.One should be satisfied with the things one have.If any case person things that he has nothing and not respecting what he/she is having.In that case one must look at people who are not having what they have.<br/>
It is well said that one respect someone when he is not having it.After having that thing he forgets to respect it.<br/>
Less desires in life leads to a happy life.The key to happiness is limiting one's desires i.e be contentment.Contentment leads to happiness.<br/>
But it is difficult to limit one's desires as we are human being so we are sometimes greedy. One can't end up all his desires.But one should try tolimit one's desires.As thing about future and desiring more and in case not getting what dreamt for leads to depression sometimes.Depression is nothing but a psycology of living alone,it generally arises of not talking to anyone,living alone and thinking about things in which you try what can's succeed.
<br/>
Enjoy life. Work on your dreams in a positive manner.Be happy and try tomake others happy,it will help one to save oneself from depression.Help others as happiness one get from helping is not going to match anything.Happiness can't be borrowed by money but it only can be achieved by one's efforts.
<br/>
So be contentment in life.
